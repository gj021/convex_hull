# Convex hull
INTRODUCTION:
The project finds a convex hull using jarvis march algorithm, given a set of points.
It has a python script(genPt.py) to generate input number of points randomly.
It also has a python script(genGraph.py) that depicts the formation of the hull.
  
 REQUIREMENTS:
g++ compiler
python3
  matplotlib
  random
  re

EXECUTION:
1.)Compile the Points.h file with a c++ compiler.
2.)Run jarvis_plot.py to generate convex hull using jarvis march
3.)Run graham_plot.py to generate convex hull using graham's scan
4.)Run kirk_plot.py to generate convex hull using kirk-patrik
